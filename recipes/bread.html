    <p><strong>Perfect homemade bread</strong></p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 package dry yeast (about 2 1/4 teaspoons)</li>
        <li>1¼ cups warm water (100° to 110°), divided</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1¼ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve sugar and yeast in 1/4 cup warm water in a large bowl; let stand 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lightly spoon flour into dry measuring cups, and level with a knife. Add 1 cup warm water, flour, and salt to yeast mixture; stir until a soft dough forms. Turn out onto a floured surface. Knead dough until smooth and elastic (about 5 minutes).</li>
        <li>Place dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to coat top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85°), free from drafts, 45 minutes or until doubled in size. (Gently press two fingers into dough. If indentation remains, dough has risen enough.</li>
        <li>Uncover dough, and punch dough down. Cover and let rise 30 minutes. Uncover dough; punch dough down. Cover and let rest 10 minutes. Roll into a 14 x 7-inch rectangle on a floured surface. Roll up tightly, starting with a short edge, pressing firmly to eliminate air pockets; pinch seam and ends to seal. Place roll, seam side down, in an 8 x 4-inch loaf pan coated with cooking spray. Cover and let rise 30 minutes or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425°.</li>
        <li>Uncover dough; gently brush with egg. Bake at 425° for 12 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350° (do not remove bread from oven); bake an additional 15 minutes or until loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Remove from pan; cool on a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
